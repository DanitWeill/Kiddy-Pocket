# Kiddy-Pocket
Kids pocket money manager for parents

This project is a kid pocket manager.
The parent can add his kids, with a starting amount of money, and choose their own picture and cell color.
Then the parent can add money to each kid in 2 ways:
1. Add amount only once  
2. adding money constantly by choosing the amount to add, the day to start adding and how often to add (every day/ week/ month/ year).

**Why did I build this project?**  
I wanted to give my kids weekly pocket money, but I kept forgetting, so I was looking for a solution and came up with this idea of pocket money manager to help parents not forget.

**What did I learn?**  
In this project I worked with firebase, and learned about the database structure , storage, users ID, setData , getDocument, transection and more.
I used tableviews, APIs, JSON parsing, MVC design, completion handlers, Layout design, cocoa touch classes, 3rd Party libraries, Cocoa pods, Swift package manager and a lot more.
